# flatMap â€” the missing function for functional Node

Those who use [underscorejs](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore) are often
[very](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/issues/436) [sad](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/issues/452), because there is no `flatMap` function.

So, ...

## Usage

```
npm install flatmap
```

```
var flatMap = require('flatmap');
```

Just like `map`, `flatMap` accepts three arguments:

  * the `array` to be traversed
  * the `iterator` function, which is invoked with three parameters

        * `value` currently iterated
        * optional `index` of current iteration
        * and optional `array` being iterated

  * the `context` value, which will be `this` inside the `iterator` function.

Example:

```
flatMap(['Hi', 'World'], function(word) {
  return word.split('');
});
// ['H', 'i', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
```

The `iterator` function can return either a value (in that case it is simply appended to results) or an array (in that case the array is concatenated with results).

Returning `null` or `undefined` from `iterator` will append nothing to the results.

**Heads up!** This is not equivalent to `_.compose(_.flatten, _.map)`, since nested sub-arrays are **not flattened**.
