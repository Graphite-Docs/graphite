# Contributing

## Issues

Feel free to submit bug reports or pull requests.

If you have a security related issue, please see the [Security Guidelines](SECURITY.md) first.

## Pull Requests

For any code changes, please ensure that:

- The latest master branch has been incorporated in your branch
- JSHint is happy
- All current tests pass
- All new tests (there are new tests, right?) pass

The git pre-commit hook should catch most of the above issues if you run `npm install` first to set it up.

unless you are certain you have the authorization to both do so and release it under MIT.
