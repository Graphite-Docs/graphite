# about

A bare-bones port of Mario Klingemann's stackblur that just operates on a Uint8 pixel array.

Original implementation:
http://www.quasimondo.com/StackBlurForCanvas/StackBlurDemo.html

# API

```
var stackblur = require('stackblur');
stackblur( pixels, width, height, radius )
```

Takes the pixel array (typically Uint8ClampedArray), the width and height of the image, and the radius to blur.
