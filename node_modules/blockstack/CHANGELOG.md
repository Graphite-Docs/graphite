# Changelog
All notable changes to the project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [18.1.0] - 2018-10-024

### Added
- The `BlockstackWallet` class in `blockstack.js` supports generating
  private keys and addresses within the hierarchical derivation scheme
  used by the Blockstack Browser and supported by the Blockstack
  ecosystem.
- A `listFiles` function allows an application to list files in its
  Gaia storage bucket.
- In the transaction generation library, the makeTX functions now
  take an optional 'buildIncomplete' argument, allowing you to get
  a serialized transaction which hasn't been fully signed yet.
- A `blockstackAPIUrl` field to the authentication response token that overrides the default
  in `blockstack.config.network` allowing the user to specify their own Blockstack
  Core node.
- A `gaiaAssociationToken` field to the authentication response token which enables
  users to run private Gaia hubs without authorization each application address.
- An option `contentType` to the `putFile` `options` object that sets the
  Content-Type header for unencrypted data. Thanks to @muneebm for this!

### Changed
- Fixed a bug in version checking during the authentication process
  that manifested itself when signing in with apps using very old versions
  of blockstack.js.
- Fixed a couple bugs in the transaction generation, networking
  code. First, coerce address now correctly coerces P2SH
  addresses. Second, bitcoinjs-lib recently switched to defaulting to
  version 2 transactions, which breaks our interoperability with a handful
  of other libraries. Finally, with this comes a little bit of refactoring,
  to reduce the repeated code in the transaction libraries.
- Increments the authentication process version to 1.3 in a backwards compatible change.
- When using the bitcoind client in development networks,
  track which addresses we've already called `importaddress` with
  and do not retry.

## [18.0.4] - 2018-08-06

### Changed
- Resolve unsupported protocol error by redirecting
  to hosted authenticator on all mobile devices

## [18.0.3] - 2018-08-01

### Changed
- Resolve unsupported protocol error by redirecting
  to hosted authenticator on iOS

## [18.0.2] - 2018-07-27

### Changed
- Update `bitcoinjs-lib` to version 4.0.0.

## [18.0.1] - 2018-07-27

### Changed
- Switched from `cross-fetch` to `cross-fetch/polyfill` to fix a bug that caused
  network requests to fail in node environments

## [18.0.0]

### Added

- Support for `verify` and `sign` keywords in `getFile` and `putFile`
  respectively. This enables support for ECDSA signatures on SHA256
  hashes in the storage operations, and works for encrypted and
  unencrypted files, in addition to multi-player reads (for
  unencrypted files).
- New `TransactionSigner` interface to allow for different signing agents
  in the `transactions` functions (e.g., makePreorder).
- `putFile` can now optionally take the public key for which you want
  to encrypt the file. Thanks to @bodymindarts for this!
- `handlePendingSignIn` now accepts `transitKey` as an optional 3rd parameter.
  This enables support for more complex sign in flows.

### Changed
- The gaia hub connection functions now use a JWT for authentication,
  the "v1" gaia authentication token. This is *not* a backwards
  compatible change-- an app using this version of `blockstack.js`
  will refuse to downgrade to the old protocol version unless the old
  gaia authentication provides a very specific challenge text matching
  the normal gaia hub challenge text.
- `encryptContent` now takes a public key instead of a private key to
  encrypt content for other users.
- The validateProofs() method now handles errors in proof-checking
  more seamlessly, properly catching failed promises. Previous error
  cases which resulted in uncaught exception warnings and null
  responses should now behave correctly.
- `handlePendingSignIn` now takes a second parameter which is the
   signed authentication response token. Thanks to @muneebm for this!
- Fixed an issue in `ecPairToHexString` that may result in generation of
  an incorrectly hex string encoding of the private key.
- Proofs now support subdomains.
- Updated a number of dependencies to fix know vulnerablities.
- Switched from isomorphic-fetch to the better maintained cross-fetch
  which will improve functionality of the library in node environments.


## [17.2.0]

### Added

- `encryptContent` and `decryptContent` methods for encrypting strings
  and buffers with specific keys, or by default, the
  appPrivateKey. Thanks to @nikkolasg and @nivas8292 for PRs on this
  work.
- Functions in `transactions` to support namespace creation
  (`NAMESPACE_PREORDER`, `NAMESPACE_REVEAL`, `NAMESPACE_IMPORT`,
  `ANNOUNCE`, and `NAMESPACE_READY`). Thanks @jcnelson.
- Support for `NAME_REVOKE` transactions. Thanks @jcnelson.
- `transactions.AmountType` Flow union type that captures both the
  type of JSON response from the stable `/v1/prices/*` RESTful
  endpoints on Blockstack Core, as well as the upcoming `/v2/prices/*`
  endpoints.
- Support for setting `blockstack.js` logLevels via
  `config.logLevel`. Supports strings: `['debug', 'info', 'warn',
  'error', 'none']` and defaults to `debug`. If you do not want
  `blockstack.js` to print anything to `console.log`, use
  `'none'`. Thanks @hstove.

### Changed

- Modified the transaction builders in `transactions.js` to accept a
  new flow type `transactions.AmountType` for the price of a name or
  namespace.  This makes them forwards-compatible with the next stable
  release of Blockstack Core.
- Added inline documentation on the wire formats of all transactions.

### Fixed

- Update to proof URLs for instagram proofs. Thanks @cponeill.
- Fixes to several safety checks. Thanks @jcnelson.
- Fixed error handling in proof validation -- several errors which
  would cause uncaught promise rejections now are handled correctly.
- Improved error handling in authentication -- if a user tries to sign
  in with an application is a different browser context, rather than
  experiencing a 'Key must be less than curve order' error, the
  authentication fails.
