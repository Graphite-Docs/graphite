## Background

### What is multistream-select

tl;dr: multistream-select is protocol multiplexing per connection/stream. [Full spec here](https://github.com/multiformats/multistream-select)

#### Select a protocol flow

The caller will send "interactive" messages, expecting for some acknowledgement from the callee, which will "select" the handler for the desired and supported protocol

```
< /multistream-select/0.3.0  # i speak multistream-select/0.3.0
> /multistream-select/0.3.0  # ok, let's speak multistream-select/0.3.0
> /ipfs-dht/0.2.3            # i want to speak ipfs-dht/0.2.3
< na                         # ipfs-dht/0.2.3 is not available
> /ipfs-dht/0.1.9            # What about ipfs-dht/0.1.9 ?
< /ipfs-dht/0.1.9            # ok let's speak ipfs-dht/0.1.9 -- in a sense acts as an ACK
> <dht-message>
> <dht-message>
> <dht-message>
```

This mode also packs a `ls` option, so that the callee can list the protocols it currently supports

## Install

### npm

```sh
> npm i multistream-select
```

### Setup

#### Node.js

```js
const multistream = require('multistream-select')
```

#### Browser: Browserify, Webpack, other bundlers

The code published to npm that gets loaded on require is in fact a ES5
transpiled version with the right shims added. This means that you can require
it and use with your favourite bundler without having to adjust asset management
process.

```js
const multistream = require('multistream-select')
```

#### Browser: `<script>` Tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make the `MultistreamSelect` obj available in
the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/multistream-select/dist/index.min.js"></script>
<!-- OR -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/multistream-select/dist/index.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Attach multistream to a connection (socket)

```JavaScript
const multistream = require('multistream-select')

const ms = new multistream.Listener()
// or
const ms = new multistream.Dialer()

// apply the multistream to the conn
ms.handle(conn, callback)
```

### This module uses `pull-streams`

We expose a streaming interface based on `pull-streams`, rather then on the Node.js core streams implementation (aka Node.js streams). `pull-streams` offers us a better mechanism for error handling and flow control guarantees. If you would like to know more about why we did this, see the discussion at this [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/362).

You can learn more about pull-streams at:

- [The history of streams, 2016](http://dominictarr.com/post/145135293917/history-of-streams)
- [pull-streams, the simple streaming primitive](http://dominictarr.com/post/149248845122/pull-streams-pull-streams-are-a-very-simple)
- [pull-streams documentation](https://pull-stream.github.io/)

#### Converting `pull-streams` to Node.js Streams

If you are a Node.js streams user, you can convert a pull-stream to a Node.js stream using the module [`pull-stream-to-stream`](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream-to-stream), giving you an instance of a Node.js stream that is linked to the pull-stream. For example:

```js
const pullToStream = require('pull-stream-to-stream')

const nodeStreamInstance = pullToStream(pullStreamInstance)
// nodeStreamInstance is an instance of a Node.js Stream
```
