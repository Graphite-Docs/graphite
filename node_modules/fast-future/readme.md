## Installation

```
npm install fast-future
```

## What? How does is work?

Since node.js v0.10.x the semantics of `process.nextTick` changed (see [docs](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.10.12/api/process.html#process_process_nexttick_callback)). To get the old behaviour one can use setImmediate instead.

The good part about `process.nextTick` is that it's really really fast. The bad part is that event loop can be starved and if run for to long time it'll eventually die with a `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`.

What's good about `setImmediate` is that it won't starve the event loop. However, it's a bit slower than `process.nextTick`.

_fast-future_ uses the best from the both worlds - the callback will most of the times be called in a process.nextTick, but once in a while it'll get run in a `setImmediate` - so you'll get crazy performance, and the event loop won't get starved or crash or something sad like that.

For me running the benchmarks show the following result

```
# setImmediate
setImmediate: 2317ms
# fastFuture
fastFuture: 96ms
```

For node v0.8.x it'll fallback to using process.nextTick

## Example

```javascript
var fastFuture = require('./fast-future')()

fastFuture(function () {
  console.log('this is being run in the future')
})
```

## Kudos

Thanks @mafintosh for suggesting this!
