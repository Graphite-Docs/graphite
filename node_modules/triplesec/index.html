                <b>TripleSec</b> is a simple to use, open-source triple-paranoid symmetric encryption library for Python,
                 Node.js, and even the browser.  It encrypts data with
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20" class="salsa20">Salsa 20</a>, 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" class="aes">AES</a>,

                so that a compromise of one or two of the ciphers will not expose the secret.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, encryption is only part of the story. TripleSec also: derives keys with
                <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html">scrypt</a> to defend
                against password-cracking and rainbow tables; authenticates 
                with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> to protect against 
                adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks; and in the JavaScript version supplements the native entropy sources
                for fear they are weak.

            Encryption is performed by the <code>encrypt</code> function. In JavaScript, it periodically yields
            control to not lock up your CPU, and finally it
            calls back with <code>(err, buffer)</code>.

            <h3>Algorithm Design</h3>            

            <p>The TripleSec library encrypts data in four steps:
              <ol>

                <li>
                  <b>Key derivation.</b> Given a user-provided password, and a
                  random salt value, generate three separate secret keys, one
                  for each cipher (see Step 3), and two final keys for
                  signing the ciphertext (see Step 4).  This "key stretching" is done via
                  standard <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html">scrypt</a>,
                  with parameters <em>N</em>=2<sup>15</sup>,
                  <em>r</em>=8, <em>p</em>=1, and output length of 192 bytes.
                  The output of this step is five seperate keys, 
                  used below.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Initial value (IV) generation.</b> A random number generator is queried 
                  to produce an initial for each of the three ciphers: a 192-bit
                  IV for Salsa20; a 128-bit IV for Twofish; and a 128-bit
                  IV for AES.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Cascading encryption.</b> Each of the ciphers runs with the keys generated
                  in Step 1, and the IVs generated in Step 2.

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p><b>Salsa20.</b> The innermost cipher is a Salsa20 variant called 
                      <a href="http://cr.yp.to/papers.html#xsalsa" class="salsa20">XSalsa20</a>.
                      Like Salsa20, XSalsa20 is a stream
                      cipher, meaning it can encrypt input texts of arbitrary length without a 
                      a block cipher mode of operation.  XSalsa20 takes a 192-bit nonce
                      rather than Salsa20's 64-bit nonce, but is provably as secure.
                      Given a key, and an IV, XSalsa20 generates a random pad,
                      which is then XOR'ed with the input message.  This step of the algorithm
                      outputs the concatenation of the IV and the result of the XOR operation.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Twofish-CTR.</b> The output of the previous step 
                      (call it <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>) is the input
                      of this step, which uses 
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish" class="twofish">Twofish</a>
                      running in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_.28CTR.29">CTR</a> mode.
                      Let <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> be the the IV generated for Twofish in Step 2.
                      Twofish-CTR works by encrypting <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>R<sub>2</sub>+1</i>, <i>R<sub>2</sub>+2</i>,...
                      with Twofish, and concatenating the result to yield a pad the size
                      of <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>. Call this pad <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> .
                      Output (<i>R<sub>2</sub></i> || (<i>P<sub>2</sub></i> ⊕ <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>)),
                      where "||" denotes concatenation, and "⊕" denotes XOR.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>AES-256-CTR.</b> In the final encryption step, apply AES-256 running
                      in CTR mode to the output of the Twofish-CTR step.  As above,
                      first XOR the output of the previous step with the pad output
                      by AES-256-CTR.  Then prepend the IV used.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>HMAC (or "sign") the ciphertext.</b> Finally, TripleSec "signs" the ciphertext
                  to ensure that no adversary tampers with it. The data to be signed
                  is everything generated to date: a small header that encapsulates the version
                  of the algorithm (now at <code>3</code>); the salt used in key derivation; and
                  the output of the AES stage of the cascading encryption above.  TripleSec "macs" with a <b>concatenation</b> of two HMACs: 
                  HMAC-SHA-512, and HMAC-SHA3, each run with a seperate key.
                  The final output is a concatenation of:
                  the header; the salt; the signature; and the outermost ciphertext.
                </li>

              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
              Though this is not the exact composition suggested by Schneier in
              <i>Applied Cryptography</i> (Section 15.8 in the Second Edition), it is
              close.  TripleSec never uses the output of one block cipher as input into the next,
              which theoretically might allow a crack of one cipher to be used to crack
              another. Rather, by merit of CTR mode, the three ciphers run on statistically 
              independent IVs, so a crack of one will not spread up or down the chain.
              The TripleSec technique takes one futher step not suggested by Schneier,
              which is to protect the inner IVs with the outer encryption algorithms, and only
              exposing the outermost IV in the clear. Though we can't prove this makes 
              the scheme more secure, it seems like a reasonable idea: why reveal cipher
              inputs if we don't have to? Finally, this algorithm has the added advantage
              that the output ciphertext only increases by a constant additive term (i.e.,
              the lengths of the header, the salt, the HMAC and the three IVs).  Schneier's
              technique inflates ciphertexts by a factor N, where N is the number of 
              independent ciphers used.
            </p>

            <p>
              Similarly, TripleSec protects against a break in HMAC-SHA-512 by always
              combining it with an HMAC based on <a href="http://keccak.noekeon.org/">Keccak hash algorithm</a> (soon to become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a> standard). 
              TripleSec concatenates the
              two results to preserve collision-resistance.  Unlike the suspect
              compositions in TLS and SSH, this simple composition doesn't require
              either SHA-512 or SHA-3 to be strongly collision-resistant; rather,
              just weakly collision-resistant in line with the
              <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/kmd5.pdf">original construction</a>.  See <a href="http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/2094/1/thesis.lehmann.pdf">Anja Lehmann's</a> dissertation
              for more details on combinations of hashes.

            <h3>Anticipated Questions</h3>
            <div class="question">
              <h5>I can understand double encryption, but triple encryption is madness!</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                User data uploaded to a remote cloud-hosted server is nearly impossible to delete,
                so any encryption scheme has to be future-proof.  The amount of time
                spent encrypting reasonably-sized plaintexts pales in comparison to 
                (1) <em>scrypt</em>, which is intentionally slow; and (2) how long it will sit on the server.
                Why not go the extra mile?
              </p>
              <h5>What's triplesec.Buffer?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                It is a wrapper around either Node.js's Buffer or a browser equivalent. When you generate
                encrypted data, you can use the output buffer however you like. In our above examples, we converted
                to and from hex strings.
              </p>
              <h5>How does TripleSec generate randomness/entropy? Can I provide my own?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                TripleSec first derives a random seed from a variety of sources:
                from <code>window.crypto.getRandomValues</code> in the browser; from <code>crypto.rng</code> in Node.js;
                from the millisecond field of your system time; and finally, from <a href="https://github.com/keybase/more-entropy">more-entropy</a>, which counts how many floating-point-heavy computations can be done in a set amount of time.
                This data is then stirred together and becomes the seed for <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf">HMAC_DRBG</a>, whose HMAC is the XOR of HMAC-SHA-512 and HMAC-SHA3.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                You may alternatively provide your own random number generator for encryption. Pass an <code>rng</code> function
                along with your other data. This function should take two 
                arguments: the number of bytes needed,
                and a callback that you fire with a <code>triplesec.WordArray</code>
                containing the random data.  You can create a <code>WordArray</code>
                from a <code>triplesec.Buffer</code> by simply calling <code>WordArray.from_buffer(buffer)</code>.
              </p>
              <h5>How are passphrases salted?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                <em>scrypt</em> takes as input a salt in addition to a secret passphrase,
                to prevent an adversary from cracking many TripleSec-encrypted ciphtertexts
                in parallel.  TripleSec salts passphrases with a 
                random 16-byte sequence that's included with the ciphertext.  By 
                default, TripleSec's <code>triplesec.Encryptor</code> object
                uses the same salt until you call <code>triplesec.Encryptor.resalt</code>.
                The advantage of salt reuse is that it's faster, since it avoids the intentionally
                slow <em>scrypt</em> step. On the other hand, an adversary can tell
                if two different ciphertexts were encrypted in the same session if
                the salt is not reset.
              </p>
              <h5>Can I encrypt files with it, in the browser?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                Yes, using HTML5 features you can access file data without uploading it to a server.
                We're also likely to add an additional interface to the encrypt and decrypt functions, where you provide a data <i>function</i> instead of a single Buffer,
                for large data performance. TripleSec was planned with this feature in mind, and it'll be easy to use.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                If you implement a file-hosting service using TripleSec, let us know, and we'll link to it in the "Who's Using It" section below.
              </p>
              <h5>Why isn't library X good enough (for X in Clipperz, Forge, SJCL, CryptoJS, etc.)?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                 There are lots of great JS Crypto libraries out there, and we've borrowed from some to build TripleSec.
                 But combining cryptographic primitives to achieve 
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability">IND-CCA2</a> security involves many fussy
                 decisions and much avoidance of implementation pitfalls.  We want all to have access to higher-level primitives that can
                 be applied with little thought.  Hence TripleSec!  
              </p>
              <h5>Is this provably secure?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                We don't have any exact proof of security for a cascade of block ciphers in CTR mode.
                But we're pretty sure TripleSec's encryption can only be broken if all three algorithms are broken.
                We furthmore think that TripleSec is non-malleable (and hence IND-CCA2 secure)
                due to the HMAC step. Let us know if there's a simple proof (or a citation) that we missed.
              </p>
              <h5>If the input message size is <i>n</i>, how big is the ciphertext?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                <i>n</i> + 208.  The additive term is broken down as:
                <ul>
                  <li>8 bytes for the header (which is <code>[0x1c94d7de, 0x3]</code>).</li>
                  <li>16 bytes for <em>scrypt</em> salt</i>
                  <li>64 bytes for the HMAC-SHA512 signature</i>
                  <li>64 bytes for the HMAC-SHA3 signature</i>
                  <li>16 bytes for AES-256 IV</i>
                  <li>16 bytes for Twofish IV</i>
                  <li>24 bytes for Salsa20 IV</i>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h5>How do I verify the implementation against known test vectors?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                In the browser, you can visit our-browser based
                <a href="test/browser/index.html">test page</a>.
                If you have Node.js on your system, you can clone the 
                <a href="http://github.com/keybase/triplesec">github repo</a>
                and run <code>make test</code>.  We've checked all algorithms
                against known test vectors, with the exception of the XSalsa20
                extension to Salsa20, which doesn't have published test vectors.
                For the XSalsa20 extension, we check outputs against the official
                <a href="https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/?repo=crypto">Go Language Crypto library</a>. We still check the underlying Salsa20 core against published test vectors.
              </p>
              <h5>I read someplace that it's impossible to write real crypto in
                JavaScript.</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                There are well-read
                articles on this topic, but we don't agree
                with a lot of the rhetoric. Of course you should deliver your Crypto
                libraries over TLS, and nowadays, that's accepted and common.
                And maybe JavaScript isn't the  most convenient language to
                write Crypto code in, but it still can express all the necessary primitives.
                Browsers have good CSPRNGs now,
                and even if you don't trust Apple and/or Linux and/or Chrome,
                we have some good workarounds (see above). True, one needs to
                take care not to overflow 32-bits, but with a robust testing
                suite against known test vectors, one can rule out this class
                of bugs. Of course one shouldn't allow untrusted libraries to
                trample one's trusted primitives, but that's true of any
                language (see <code> LD_PRELOAD</code> attacks against
                libraries written in C). A shortcoming we encountered
                in writing TripleSec is that 
                JavaScript doesn't offer destructors, so
                it's inconvenient to scrub  buffers properly. 
                TripleSec has taken care to do this job manually.  If
                you spot some unscrubbed buffers, please let us know.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">We are as worried as anyone else about 
                XSS attacks, CSRF attacks and the ability of third party code to tamper
                with vetted Crypto code. But these attacks and the quality of
                Crypto libraries are othogonal concerns. Those sites with
                high quality JS libraries should feel confident encrypting
                data with TripleSec.  Those with lots of unvetted third party
                JS code won't gain much.
              </p>

              <h5>Is there a streaming interface?</h5>
              <p class="answer">
                Not yet, it's in progress.  The current interface requires the file to be fully loaded into memory
                before it's encrypted, but the current file format is compatible with streaming (with a single seek to
                write the HMACs).
