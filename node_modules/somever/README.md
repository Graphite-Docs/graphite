# somever

Semantic versioning rules parser, compatible with version ranges used in package.json files and the
canonical [semver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) module. If you are looking for a general
purpose semantic versioning parser, **semver** provides a richer set of utilities. This module is
meant to work as part of the hapi ecosystem which does not rely on external dependencies.
