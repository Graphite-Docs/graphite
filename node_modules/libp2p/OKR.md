# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q3

Find the js-libp2p OKRs for 2018 Q2 at the [2018 Q3 libp2p OKRs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HTXfgR5FyPTFhsTkFPRThkeMvHvCgJOaAs7BSl_vQ_0/edit#gid=1241853194)

## Previous Quarters

For the quarters before 2018 Q3, js-libp2p shared their KRs with the [IPFS OKRs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/OKR.md).
