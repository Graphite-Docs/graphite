Contributing
============

We maintain a Contributing section for both new and seasoned contributors in
our docs. Read the hosted version at
https://remotestoragejs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html or find the
RST files in the ``doc/`` directory of this repo.

There's a section about [our GitHub
workflow](https://remotestoragejs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/github-flow.html),
containing useful tips and help for making collaboration easier and our Git
history more useful.
