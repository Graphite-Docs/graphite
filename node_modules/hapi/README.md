### Web and services application framework

Lead Maintainer: [Eran Hammer](https://github.com/hueniverse)

**hapi** is a simple to use configuration-centric framework with built-in support for input validation, caching,
authentication, and other essential facilities for building web and services applications. **hapi** enables
developers to focus on writing reusable application logic in a highly modular and prescriptive approach. 

This **v16** is a maintenance-only branch for those unable to update to the latest major
version of the core module. It on receives critical bug fixes and security patches. It will stop
being maintained on March 1st, 2019.
