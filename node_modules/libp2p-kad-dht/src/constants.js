// MaxRecordAge specifies the maximum time that any node will hold onto a record

// the record may contain.
// For example, a record may contain an ipns entry with an EOL saying its valid
// until the year 2020 (a great time in the future). For that record to stick around
// it must be rebroadcasted more frequently than once every 'MaxRecordAge'
