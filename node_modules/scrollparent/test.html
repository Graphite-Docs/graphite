  Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
  roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
  2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
  College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
  consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
  the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
  Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
  et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
  BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
  the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
  amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
